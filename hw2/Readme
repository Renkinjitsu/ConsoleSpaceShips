Student dependent decisions
===========================
- An item that falls indirectly on a ship is not considered as crashed into the ship.
- The small ship may rotate in the same cycle as moving/advancing/position-changing.
- A ship may push a free-falling item.
- Only a ship can go through the exit point.
- A ship can't push another ship.
