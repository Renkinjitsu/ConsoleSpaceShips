Known bugs:
- None.

TODO:
- [Failed to] Verify that ships can't push items downwards.

Unmet requirements:
- A ship might get under a falling item without explode (when it shoudn't).
- Ships may push upwards an item pile that is too heavy.

Student dependent decisions:
- An item that falls indirectly on a ship is not considered as crashed into the ship.
- The small ship may rotate in the same cycle as moving/advancing/position-changing.
- A ship may push a free-falling item.
- Only a ship can go through the exit point.
- A ship can't push another ship.
