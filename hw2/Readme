==========
Known bugs
==========
- Non-falling items also crash a ship
- A ship might get under a falling item without explode (when it shoudn't).
- Ships may push upwards an item pile that is too heavy.

====
TODO
====
- [Failed to] Verify that ships can't push items downwards.
- Verify small ship can't rotate while carring items
- Verify behavior for a wal that is partially damaged by explosion
- Transform 'Area : GameObject' to 'Rectangle : None'
- BadShip

==================
Unmet requirements
==================
- At the (successful) end of a level, go to the next.
- If the last level is completed, show a message and wait for a keypress. then, return to the main menu.
- The levels are ordered by their ID.
- Need to read the requirements of 2nd work block.

 - Arguments:
    The path must be quoted (dir /b "d:\path\some sub folder with spaces")
    string command = "dir /b \"" + path + "\"";
    Test:
    > "C:\Users\or\Desktop\space ship\"
    > "C:\Users\or\Desktop\space ship\\"

===========================
Student dependent decisions
===========================
- An item that falls indirectly on a ship is not considered as crashed into the ship.
- The small ship can't rotate in the same cycle as moving/advancing/position-changing.
- A ship may push a free-falling item.
- Only a ship can go through the exit point.
- A ship can't push another ship.
