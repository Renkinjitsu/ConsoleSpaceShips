==========
Known bugs
==========
- Non-falling items also crash a ship
- A ship might get under a falling item without explode (when it shoudn't).
- Ships may push upwards an item pile that is too heavy.

====
TODO
====
- [Failed to] Verify that ships can't push items downwards.
- Verify small ship can't rotate while carring items
- Fix behavior for a wall that is partially damaged by explosion
- Transform 'Area : GameObject' to 'Rectangle : None'
- BadShip
[V] Character 'W'
[V] Size: 1x1
[V] follows the player's ships
[V] Terget suicide explosion
  > Destroed by free falling items

[V]Bomb
[V] Character '*'
[V] Detonate on touch (with any object)
[V] explosion is in a rext of x+-4, y+-4
[V] Any object (exept for exit points) in the explosion rect is destroyed

 - Slow push
[V] On-offswitch key: 'b'
  > Slow push mode needs to be displayed
  > slow-push means that items do have friction

 - 3 more screens

==================
Unmet requirements
==================
- If the last level is completed, show a message and wait for a keypress. then, return to the main menu.

 - Arguments:
    The path must be quoted (dir /b "d:\path\some sub folder with spaces")
    string command = "dir /b \"" + path + "\"";
    Test:
    > "C:\Users\or\Desktop\space ship\"
    > "C:\Users\or\Desktop\space ship\\"

===========================
Student dependent decisions
===========================
- An item that falls indirectly on a ship is not considered as crashed into the ship.
- The small ship can't rotate in the same cycle as moving/advancing/position-changing.
- A ship may push a free-falling item.
- Only a ship can go through the exit point.
- A ship can't push another ship.
- Gravity affects 'Bomb'-s
- Bad spaceship can't push objects
- Bad spaceship recognize obsticales only if it immediately blocks it
- Exit point is immune to damage

Bad spaceship hunting
=====================

Step-distance
*************
Sum of difference on each axis.

Target selection
****************
Bad spaceship hunts the closest non-bad spaceship.
If both the small & the big spaceships are at the same step-distance, the target shall be the big spaceship.

Movement
********
Let <x> be the step-distance on the X axis
Let <y> be the step-distance on the Y axis
If <x> >= <y>
 let <C> be X axis
else,
 let <C> be Y axis
advance twords the target on <C>
